## 10/11/18 UPDATE
Hello first of all thanks for your continued support - it's very helpful!
I have decided to discontinue Tapp Version 2 and develop Tapp version 3. I have a lot planned in this update including a redesign. I will be hiring an interface designer for this purpose. I do not know how long this will take between getting the site back up and getting the next version out..

## What to expect
A fully functional and reliable application which is amazing at telling your vehicle what to do. I have designed Tapp to run like a tank, and have tested it on multiple devices. I have partial touchbar support, and hope to include full support in later updates. I have redesigned Tapp constantly over recent months and will continue to do so, as I'm a bit of a perfectionist. I do not have streaming yet, so the vehicle location will update every 5 seconds.
